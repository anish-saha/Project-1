# Virus Project
Simulation of a virus. Follows mathematical trends of exponential population growth based on given data values.
To try it out, simply run the program and input values as you see fit. I would recommend a small starting population,
a large maximum population, a high reproduction rate, a low mortality rate, and a greater number of trials. However,
feel free to tinker with these values and study the graphs as necessary.
