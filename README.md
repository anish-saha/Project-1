# Virus Project
Simulation of virus populations. Follows mathematical trends of exponential growth and decay based on given data values.
To try it out, simply run the program and input values as you see fit. I recommend a small starting population,
a large maximum population, a high reproduction rate, a low mortality rate, and a greater number of trials. But feel 
free to tinker with these values and study the graphs as necessary. Use the command `python3 virus.py` to try it out!
